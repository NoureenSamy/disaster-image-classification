# 🌪️ Disaster Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for **classifying images of disasters**, including natural calamities such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. The dataset is processed, augmented, and used to train a CNN to distinguish between different disaster categories with high accuracy.
